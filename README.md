# Adapters

> Convert raw data dumps into a format usable by `syft` üî¢üê†

## Current Proposal

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TIiIm0aYILd02tfLM57IaLEOs94f1OYa12d5hIw7B_4/edit?usp=sharing

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Any version of Node 6 and above. Recommended versions of npm is v4 or a recent version of Yarn.

### Installing
The dashboard is built with React, and can be installed by running:

```bash
1. git clone https://github.com/OpenMined/Adapters.git
2. npm install
3. npm start
```
_note:_ `npm` can be substituted with `yarn`.

## Usage

Not much here yet just a general idea on usage we agreed on so far:

Adapters should be executable as binaries with a `pipe` interface.

## Running the tests
Testing is done with Jest and Mocha.

### And coding style tests

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
